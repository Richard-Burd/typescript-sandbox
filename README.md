# TypeScript Sandbox
This is a sandbox to fool around with and learn TypeScript.&nbsp; It follows the video tutorial series [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gUgr39Q_yD6v-bSyMwKPUI) by the Net Ninja.

## Getting Started:
This repo is based off of this one [here](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/typescript-tutorial/tree/lesson-10) with more notes etched out in the comments.&nbsp; To fire it up, clone it locally and run these commands:
1. `$ npm install -g http-server` To get a server going (globally) if you don't already have one set up.
2. `$ sudo npm install -g typescript` To get TypeScript installed globally as well
3. `$ tsc -w` **(in the repo directory)** To get the TypeScript fired up and running
4. `$ http-server -c-1` **(in the repo directory)** To fire up the server

## TypeScript Illustrated Cheat Sheet:
A PDF version is available in the codebase above, open it in Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge as Firefox and Acrobat cannot display PDF's properly when they are generated from Inkscape SVG files.
