# TypeScript Sandbox
This is a sandbox to fool around with and learn TypeScript.&nbsp; It follows the video tutorial series [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gUgr39Q_yD6v-bSyMwKPUI) by the Net Ninja.

## Getting Started:
This repo is an almost identical copy of this one [here](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/typescript-tutorial/tree/lesson-10) with more notes etched out in the comments.&nbsp; To fire it up, clone it locally and run these commands:
1. `$ npm install -g http-server` To get a server going (globally) if you don't already have one set up.
2. `$ sudo npm install -g typescript` To get TypeScript installed globally as well
3. `$ tsc -w` **(in the repo directory)** To get the TypeScript fired up and running
4. `$ http-server -c-1` **(in the repo directory)** To fire up the server

## Cool Graphics:
Here is my master cheat-sheet for TypeScript so far:

Now that I have a cheat-sheet going, my next step is to implement TypeScript in my [Front End Portfolio Project](https://github.com/Richard-Burd/front-end-portfolio-project); specifically, to build out [these JavaScript class objects](https://github.com/Richard-Burd/front-end-portfolio-project/blob/master/front-end/src/objects.js) in TypeScript.
